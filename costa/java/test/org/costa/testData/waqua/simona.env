#
# This file contains most of the machine dependent quantities with
# respect to SIMONA. The file is read by each SIMONA program and the
# information is stored in-core in some common blocks.
#
# - syntax: [ keyword ]  =  [ value ]
# - Lines starting with # are treated as comment lines
# - Keywords and values are processed case-insensitive
