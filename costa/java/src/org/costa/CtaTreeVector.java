/*
 *
 * Interface description of the COSTA default CtaTreeVector component.
 *
 * The CtaTreeVector is an extension of a vector component. A treevector
 * either contains a single vector or is a concatenation of a number of
 * treevectors, called sub-treevectors in this context. The usage of
 * sub-treevectors makes is possible to concatenate models or extend models
 * as is done when a deterministic model is extended into a stochastic model.
 * The sub-treevector are also very useful inside the model source code where the
 * whole treevector is not represented by a single vector.  The default tree-vector
 * component uses COSTA vector-components for storing the values.
 *
 * Each (sub) treevector has a id. CtaTreeVector vectors having the same id are considered
 * to be the same, meaning they have the same buildup in subtreevectors, length and
 * datatypes.
 *
