Revision 676: 09-Oct-2008
* Parallel model builder is extended such that within a worker-worker model it is possible to denote
  a process that does not take part in the worker-worker model. This is e.g. for models that have some additional 
  process for monitoring stuff.
* A bug is fixed in the rrsqrt filter. Due to this bug, the observations were assimilated of one timestep in the future
* The default setting for the rrsqrt filter is to NOT propagate the noise parameters
* Several small bugs are fixed in the coffee filter implementation
* The treevector is extended with a function to find the number of subtrees. 
* The rrsqrt_kalmina filter is extended in order to be able to handle the noise of concatinated models. This works fine
  now for parallel models but done in a more elegant way, but this will need some additional work on this filter
* several small bugs are solved in the parallel model builder.


Revision 36: 19-Oct-2006
* Added function CTA_Tree_CountHandlesStr (Similar to CTA_Tree_CountHandles
  but path may be provided directly as a string
* The oscill model is upgraded. Model parameters can now be set through the
* COSTA interface and XML-input-file (by Julius H. Sumihar)

Revision 35: 19-Oct-2006
* The separate library containing the Fortran interfacing is removed. All
  interfacing is now moved to the code of the components in the
  src-directory.
* The SP-Modelbuilder is now a part of the COSTA-core library and will be
  automatically initialized.

*CTA_FILE_STDOUT
 New constante CTA_FILE_STDOUT: Handle to a COSTA file that writes to standard out.

*Interface change of export functions
 The interface of the export functions is changed. The "ndata" argument is removed for all export functions. The configuration (argument ursdata) is
 no longer an array but a single COSTA handle.
 This change resulted in changes on the interface of
 Vector
 State-vector
 Matrix
 Stoch observer

*Fortran interface of tree-methods
 The Fortran interface of the tree functions was different for Fortran than
 for C. This is changed. As a rusult the following method names have been
 changed:
 cta_tree_add_handle       -> cta_tree_addhandle
 cta_tree_count_handles    -> cta_tree_counthandles
 cta_tree_count_handlesstr -> cta_tree_counthandlesstr
 cta_tree_get_handlestr    -> cta_tree_gethandlestr
 cta_tree_get_valuestr     -> cta_tree_getvaluestr
 cta_tree_get_handle       -> cta_tree_gethandle
 cta_tree_get_value        -> cta_tree_getvalue
 cta_tree_count_items      -> cta_tree_countitems
 cta_tree_get_item         -> cta_tree_getitem
 cta_tree_get_itemvalue    -> cta_tree_getitemvalue

*Change te model interface
 The function CTA_Model_Axpy is renamed to CTA_Model_AxpyState. This is
 more conform to the other methods of the model interface.
