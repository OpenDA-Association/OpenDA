Overview
--------
COSTA is a modular framework for data assimilation, containing methods and
tools that can be easily applied to a wide range of applications. It
allows reuse of data assimilation software, thus reducing the costs of
applying data assimilation methods. At the same time, it allows new
developments in the field of data assimilation to quickly spread to all
applications that might benefit from it.

Getting Started
---------------
The documentation on COSTA is provided in the subdirectory `doc'. The main
point of entry is the file `doc/index.html'.

The Getting Started document introduces COSTA to a new user. It provides
an overview of the system, the basic design choices, and introduces the
important aspects one needs to be familiar with in order to apply COSTA
to ones own computational model. 

For installation instructions see the accompanying file INSTALL, or take a
look at the Developers Guide. After succesfull compilation of all parts of
the COSTA system you may run the tests provided in the `tests'-directory to
see whether the installation is correct, and you may then start
experimenting with the models and data assimilation schemes provided in the
`examples'-directory.
