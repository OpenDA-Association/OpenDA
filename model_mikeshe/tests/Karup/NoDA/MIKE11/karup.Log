  Warning No 65: In river HADERUP RIVER : 14200.000 meter there is a difference
                 in the bed level of the rivers meeting at the intersection.
                 The lowest bed level (8.500 meter) is found in river KARUP RIVER at
                 chainage 49750.000 meter. The highest level (9.500 meter) is found in river HADERUP RIVER at
                 chainage 14200.000 meter.
                 A difference in bed level for the rivers meeting may cause
                 mass errors and instabilities especially if low flow is simulated.

  Warning No 42: The lateral outflow in HADERUP RIVER : 0.000 meter
                 was greater than  the amount of water available.
                 The lateral outflow has been modified to avoid the local water
                 level falling below the bed level. This modification has
                 occured 595 times. First time at time step 4203.
  Warning No 53: The total corrected volume is 2.791 m^3.
  Warning No 42: The lateral outflow in FELDBORG CREEK : 0.000 meter
                 was greater than  the amount of water available.
                 The lateral outflow has been modified to avoid the local water
                 level falling below the bed level. This modification has
                 occured 9948 times. First time at time step 2.
  Warning No 53: The total corrected volume is 244.937 m^3.
  Warning No 42: The lateral outflow in BRANCHY : 0.000 meter
                 was greater than  the amount of water available.
