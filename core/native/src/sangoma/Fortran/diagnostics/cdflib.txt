                          SUMMARY OF DCDFLIB

This  library  contains routines  to compute  cumulative  distribution
functions, inverses, and    parameters  of the  distribution  for  the
following set of statistical distributions:

    (1) Beta
    (2) Binomial
    (3) Chi-square
    (4) Noncentral Chi-square
    (5) F
    (6) Noncentral F
    (7) Gamma
    (8) Negative Binomial
    (9) Normal
    (10) Poisson
    (11) Student's t

Given values of all but one parameter of a distribution, the other is
computed.  These calculations are done with  FORTRAN Double Precision 
variables.

          -------------------- WARNINGS --------------------

The F and  Noncentral F distribution are  not necessarily monotone  in
either degree  of  freedom argument.  Consequently,  there  may be two
degree of freedom arguments that satisfy the specified condition.  An
arbitrary one of these will be found by the cdf routines.

The  amount of computation  required for  the noncentral chisquare and
noncentral F  distribution    is proportional  to  the  value  of  the
noncentrality   parameter.  Very large values  of   this parameter can
require  immense   numbers of   computation.  Consequently,  when  the
noncentrality parameter is to  be calculated, the upper limit searched
is 10,000.

        -------------------- END WARNINGS --------------------

                            DOCUMENTATION

This  file  contains an  overview  of the library   and is the primary
documentation.

Other documentation  is  in  directory 'doc'  on  the  distribution as
character  (ASCII) files.  A summary  of all of the available routines
is contained in dcdflib.chs (chs is an abbreviation of 'cheat sheet').
The 'chs'  file  will probably be  the  primary reference.  The  file,
dcdflib.fdoc, contains the  header comments for each  routine intended
for direct use.

                             INSTALLATION

The Fortran source routines are contained in directory src.  

A  few  routines use   machine  dependent  constants.  Lists  of  such
constants for different machines are found in ipmpar.f.  Uncomment the
ones  appropriate to your  machine.  The distributed  version uses the
IEEE arithmetic that is used by  the IBM PC,  Macintosh, and most Unix
workstations.

Ignore compilation warnings that lines of code are  not reachable.  We
write in a Fortran structured preprocessor (FLECS)  that is similar in
spirit to  Ratfor.   Sometimes our coding  practices in  FLECS lead to
unreachable lines.   Also, FLECS inserts   lines of code:  STOP  "CODE
FLOWING  INTO   FLECS   PROCEEDURES".  All   such    lines should   be
unreachable.

                    HOW TO USE THE ROUTINES

The calling sequence for each routine is of the form:

  SUBROUTINE CDF<name>( WHICH, P, Q, X, <parameters>, STATUS, BOUND ).

WHICH and STATUS are INTEGER, all other arguments are DOUBLE PRECISION.

<name> is a one to  three character name identifying the distribution.
WHICH  is an input integer value  that identifies what parameter value
is to be calculated from the values of the other parameters.

P is always the cdf evaluated at X, Q is always the compliment of the
cdf evaluated at X, i.e.  1-P, and X is always the value at which the
cdf  is evaluated.   The auxiliary parameters,  <parameters>,  of the
distribution differ by distribution.

If WHICH is 1, P and  Q are to be calculated, i.e., the cdf; if WHICH
is 2, X is to be calculated, i.e., the inverse cdf.  The value of one
auxiliary parameter in <parameters> can also be the value calculated.

STATUS returns 0 if the calculation completes correctly.

           --------------------WARNING--------------------

If STATUS is not 0, no meaningful answer is returned.

        -------------------- END WARNING --------------------

STATUS returns  -I if the I'th  input parameter was  not  in the legal
range (see below).  Parameters are counted  with WHICH being the first
in these return values.

A STATUS  value of 1 indicates that  the desired answer was apparently
lower than the lower bound on the search interval.  A return code of 2
indicates that  the answer was  apparently higher than the upper bound
on the search interval.  A return code of 3 indicates that P and Q did
not sum to 1. Other positive codes are routine specific.

BOUND is not  set if STATUS is returned  as 0.  If  STATUS is -I  then
BOUND is   the bound illegally  exceeded by  input  parameter I, where
WHICH  is  counted as 1,  P as 2,  Q as 3,  X as 4, etc.  If STATUS is 
returned as 1 or 2 then BOUND  is returned as the lower or upper bound
on the search interval respectively.

                                BOUNDS

Below are  the rules that we used  in determining bounds on quantities
to be  calculated.   Those who don't care   can find a summary  of the
bounds in  dcdflib.chs.   Input bounds  are  checked for  legality  of
input.  The search  range  is  the range   of values searched  for  an
answer.

                             Input Bounds

Bounds on input parameters are  checked by the  CDF* routines.   These
bounds were set according to the following rules.

P: If the  domain of the cdf (X) extends to  -infinity  then P must be
greater than 0 otherwise P must be greater than or equal to 0.  P must
always be less than or equal to 1.

Q: If the  domain of the cdf (X) extends to  +infinity  then Q must be
greater than 0 otherwise Q must be greater than or equal to 0.  Q must
always be less than or equal to 1.

Further, P and Q must sum to 1. The smaller of the two P and Q will be
used in calculations to increase accuracy

X:  If  the  domain is infinite  in   either the positive  or negative
direction, no check  is performed in  that direction.  If the left end
of the domain is 0, then X is checked to assure non-negativity.

DF, SD, etc.:  Some auxiliary parameters must  be positive. The lowest
input values accepted for these parameters is 1E-300.


                                Search Bounds

These are the  ranges searched for an  answer.   If the domain  of the
parameter in the cdf  is closed at  some  finite value, e.g., 0,  then
this value is the same endpoint of the search range.  If the domain is
open  at  some finite   endpoint (which only  occurs   for  0 --  some
parameters must be strictly positive) then  the endpoint is 1E-300. If
the  domain is infinite in either  direction then +/- 1E300 is used as
the endpoint of the search range.

                        HOW THE ROUTINES WORK

The cumulative  distribution   functions are computed  directly.   The
normal, gamma,  and  beta functions use the  code  from the references
cited.  Other  cdfs are calculated  by relating them  to one  of these
distributions.  For example, the  binomial and negative binomial  cdfs
can be converted  to a beta cdf.   This is how fractional observations
are handled.  The  formula from Abramowitz  and Stegun  for converting
the cdfs is cited  in the fdoc file.    (We think the formula  for the
negative binomial in A&S is wrong, but there is a correct one which we
used.)

The inverse normal and gamma are also taken  from the references.  For
all other parameters, a search is made for the value that provides the
desired P.  Initial  values are chosen crudely  for the search  (e.g.,
5).  If the domain  of the cdf for the  parameter being calculated  is
infinite, a step doubling strategy is  used to bound the desired value
then the  zero  finder is  employed  to refine the answer.    The zero
finder attempts to obtain the answer accurately to about eight decimal
places.

C     The  value  of the  cumulative  noncentral F distribution is not
C     necessarily monotone in either degrees  of freedom.  There  thus
C     may be two values that provide a given  CDF value.  This routine
C     assumes monotonicity  and will find  an arbitrary one of the two
C     values.

C     acm Transactions on Mathematical Software. 19, 22-32.
C
C     is used to calulate the  cumulative standard normal distribution.
C
C     The rational functions from pages  90-95  of Kennedy and Gentle,
C     Statistical  Computing,  Marcel  Dekker, NY,  1980 are  used  as
C     starting values to Newton's Iterations which compute the inverse
C     standard normal.  Therefore no  searches  are necessary for  any
C     parameter.
C
C     For X < -15, the asymptotic expansion for the normal is used  as
C     the starting value in finding the inverse standard normal.
C     This is formula 26.2.12 of Abramowitz and Stegun.
