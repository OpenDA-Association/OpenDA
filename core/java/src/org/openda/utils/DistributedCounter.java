/**
 * This is an implementation of a special counter that is used in distributed computations
 * The increment of this counter is determined by static increment
 * This counter can be used to replace static counter variables in round robin parallel distribution
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The ordering of double[] java-arrays is with the first dimension running slowest, eg the array [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
 *   is returned/set as [1,2,3,4,5,6] , this is consistent with conventions in c or java.
 * - Indices start at 0, consistent with c/java conventions.
 * - The index for dimension starts counting at 0, thus 0 denotes the first dimension.
