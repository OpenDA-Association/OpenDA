/**
 * Subset of java.util.Observable, Observer methods. These classes in java annoyingly do not implement 
 * interfaces, so they can not be used when a class must extend another class, because java
 * does not support multiple inheritance
 * 
 * The two interfaces IMyObservable and IMyObserver together implement the observer-pattern.
 * Standard implementations MyObservable and MyObserver can be used to simplify implementation.
 * 
 * Intro: The observer pattern implements a call-bck mechanism to notify other classes when something 
 * has happened. This avoids frequent polling (asking if something has happened) and is more modular.
