//// PlotLive
/**
Plot signals dynamically, where points can be added at any time
and the display will be updated.  This should be normally used
with some finite persistence so that old points are erased as new
points are added.  Unfortunately, the most efficient way to erase
old points is to draw graphics using the "exclusive or" mode, which
introduces quite a number of artifacts.  When lines are drawn
between points, where they overlap the points the line becomes
white. Moreover, if two lines or points overlap completely, they
disappear.
<p>
This class is abstract, so it must be used by creating a derived
class.  To use it, create a derived class with an
addPoints() method. Your class may also set graph parameters like
titles and axis labels in the constructor by calling
methods in the Plot or PlotBox classes (both of which are base classes).
The addPoints() method should call addPoint() of the Plot base
class to dynamically add points to the plot.  This method is called
within a thread separate from the applet thread, so the zooming
mechanism and buttons remain live.
