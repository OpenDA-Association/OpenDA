//// CloseListener
/**
This is an interface for listeners that need to be informed when a
window closes.  Note that this is a very small subset of what Java's
WindowListener interface does.  This class is a workaround for a bug
in Java's AWT, where components are not informed in any way when the
window that contains them is closed, even though they can have
registered listeners.  The listeners are never called, unless the
component is a top-level window. A listener that implements this
interface, by contrast, is informed regardless of whether it is
at the top level. This is used, for example, by the ComponentDialog
class.
