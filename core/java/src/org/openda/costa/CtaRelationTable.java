	    * A useful application of this method is to create a relation table that

	    * the elements of set2. In order to set a relation table of this kind first
	    * create two relation tables:
	    * hrel1 elements from set 1 that have a relation with the elements from set 2,
	    * hrel2 elements from set 2 that have a relation with the elements from set 1
	    *
	    * The combined relation table of hrel1 and inverse(hrel2) is a relation
	    * table that specifies the relation of a subset of elements from set1 and a
	    * subset of elements from set2.
