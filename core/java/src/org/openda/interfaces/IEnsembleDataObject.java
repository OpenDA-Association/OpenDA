/**
 * Interface that can be implemented by DataObjects or IoObjects.
 * This interface contains methods to get ensemble exchange items (i.e. exchange items for which there are ensemble members available).
 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 *
 * If a DataObject implements this interface, then the following methods should ignore any ensemble exchange items:
 * getExchangeItemIDs()
 * getExchangeItemIDs(IPrevExchangeItem.Role role)
 *
 * If a DataObject implements this interface, then the following method should throw an IllegalStateException when it is called for an ensemble exchange item:
 * getDataObjectExchangeItem(String exchangeItemID)
 * This IllegalStateException should state that the method getDataObjectExchangeItem(String exchangeItemId, int ensembleMemberIndex) should be called instead.
 *
 * If an IoObject implements this interface, then the following method should ignore any ensemble exchange items:
 * getExchangeItems()
