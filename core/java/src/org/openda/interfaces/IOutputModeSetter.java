/**
 * This interface has been introduced for the BmiModelInstance, the only
 * implementer of this interface.
 * It is used to indicate that the model should return output (i.e. the
 * buffered state items buffered per time step), instead of the 'regular'
 * input/output state item that is adjusted by the filter.
 * A state variable and a related buffered output state item have the
 * same exchange item id, which originates the problem.
 * So a final solution has to be found in configuring the items in the
 * BmiModelInstance in a different way (see ODA-624).
