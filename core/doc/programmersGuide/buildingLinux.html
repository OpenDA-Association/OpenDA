<h1>Building the OpenDA native source code (Linux)</h1>

<hr>

This page describes how to build the OpenDA native source code on Linux computers. The source code is located in the
<tt>core/native</tt>
directory of the source distribution. On Linux, the native sources are compiled using the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake" target="_blank">GNU Automake system</a>
<p>
Directory <tt>scripts</tt> of the source distribution contains a script <tt>openda_build_native.sh</tt> that
may be useful to compile the native code. It was tested for Ubuntu 8.04 lts 32-bit only. In this script, you
will recognize the steps described below.

<h2>Building step-by-step</h2>

<ol>

   <li>The first step is starting the <tt>configure</tt> script, usually through <tt>./configure</tt> (to ensure the script you
   are starting is the one in the current directory and not another one from the search path). This will detect the configuration of
   the computer being used and will warn when specific requirements are not met. When all requirements are met, make files will be
   generated. It is possible to alter the behaviour of the <tt>configure</tt> script by using command-line arguments. The most
   important ones are:
   <ul>
      <li><tt>--help</tt> will list all options with some help text.</li>
      <li><tt>--prefix=PATH</tt> indicates the place the library should be copied to after <tt>make install</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>--disable-mpi</tt> disables MPI.</li>
      <li><tt>--with-blas=PATH</tt> indicates the location of the BLAS library. By default, an unoptimized BLAS library is
      used.</li>
      <li><tt>--with-lapack=PATH</tt> indicates the location of the LAPACK library, an unoptimized LAPACK library is used.</li>
      <li><tt>--with-jdk=PATH</tt> indicates the location of the Java Development Kit (JDK) if it differs from the value of <tt>$JAVA_HOME</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>--with-jikes=PATH</tt> indicates the location of the Jikes Java compiler in case that compiler is to be used.
      Default: no.</li>
   </ul>
   Do not forget to scan the <tt>configure</tt> output for warnings. Those are often very informative.
   </li>
   <li>The second step is using <tt>make</tt> to build (compile and link) the source files.</li>
   <li>The final step is copying the resulting libraries (and executables) to the place specified using <tt>configure</tt>'s <tt>--prefix=</tt>
   command-line argument. This step is activated by <tt>make install</tt>.
</ol>
The Automake system also generated the other usual
<tt>make</tt>
options (like
<tt>make clean</tt>
). It is unlikely that you want to remove the libraries and executables you just built, but in case you want to, this is nice to
know.

<h2>Note about OpenMPI</h2>

There is a known problem with OpenMPI versions 1.3 and 1.4 where an external dependency
<tt>mca_base_param_reg_int</tt>
cannot be found during run-time. This can be avoided by recompiling OpenMPI itself. Use command-line arguments
<tt>--enable-shared --enable-static</tt>
when running the
<tt>config</tt>
script.
