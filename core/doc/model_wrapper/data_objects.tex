\odachapter{Important data objects}

This chapter will describe some important data objects that can be used for multiple different wrappers when reading observations, model results or even updating states or boundary conditions.

\section{NetcdfDataObject}

The netcdf data object is very useful since many different model software packages use netcdf files for storing and reading data.

\oda has created the data object org.openda.exchange.dataobjects.NetcdfDataObject for this.
It supports many different variable formats like scalar and gridded but not all since there can be an infinite number of different variable formats with infinite dimensions.
The most important ones will be described here.
