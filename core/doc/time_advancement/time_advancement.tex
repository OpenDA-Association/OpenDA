\section{Introduction}

An \oda Stochastic Model may be limited in the number of time steps that can
be advanced without recomputing the forcing terms. Storage of the forcing terms
can be quite expensive in memory and may therefore be limited to a maximum.

A problem arises when the first observation, i.e.\ the first analysis time,
falls outside the interval for which the forcing terms are computed. In that
case, the first model instantiation already needs to compute new forcing terms,
while these terms should still be kept in memory for the other instantiations.

There are two possibilities to circumvent this problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item use option {\tt<analysisTimes type="fixed">} in the ModelConfig file to
  force the stochastic model to stop at a point in time that falls within the
  interval for which the forcing terms were computed.
\item use attribute \verb1flag_barrier1 in the model\_class file to indicate
  that the computation of a model instantiation must be temporarily blocked at a
  certain moment in time until all instantiations have reached this point. Once
  all instantiations have reached this point, the computation of all model
  instantiation is advanced until the next barrier moment.
\end{itemize}
More details on both options are presented in the following sections.

\section{Setting fixed analysis times}

Fixed analysis time must be specified in the ModelConfig file. For example, the
line
\begin{verbatim}
<analysisTimes type="fixed" timeFormat="dateTimeString">
200701010000,200701010060,...,200701020000</analysisTimes>}
\end{verbatim}
forces an \oda run to interrupt the computation every hour. This means that
the stochastic model is restarted a number of times. Depending on the file I/O
that is needed for a restart, this may slow down the \oda computation more
than necessary.

\section{Setting a barrier for a model computation}

The {\tt CTA\_MODELCLASS} is created in the model\_class file. The line
\begin{verbatim}
<CTA_MODELCLASS id="modelclass"  name="example">
\end{verbatim}
may be augmented with the option {\tt flag\_barrier}. If this flag is set {\tt
  true}, then one must also specify a parameter {\tt T\_step}, representing the
maximum time interval that the model may run without recomputing the forcing
terms. This parameter must be specified by the user as only the user knows what
the time-stepping limitations of his stochastic model are.

The default unit for {\tt T\_step} is Modified Julian Day ({\tt MJD}). It is
also possible to specify the time in hours ({\tt HOUR}), minutes ({\tt MIN}) or
seconds ({\tt SEC}). Other time units are not supported yet and it is also not
possible to use a combination of units.

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item set a maximum time step of 0.1 Modified Julian Day:
\begin{verbatim}
<CTA_MODELCLASS id="modelclass"  name="example"
flag_barrier="true" T_step = "0.1">
\end{verbatim}
which is equivalent to:
\begin{verbatim}
<CTA_MODELCLASS id="modelclass"  name="example"
flag_barrier="true" T_step = "0.1 MJD">
\end{verbatim}

\item set a maximum time step of 1 hour and 30 min:
\begin{verbatim}
<CTA_MODELCLASS id="modelclass" name="example" flag_barrier="true"
T_step = "1.5 HOUR">
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
<CTA_MODELCLASS id="modelclass" name="example" flag_barrier="true"
T_step = "90 MIN">
\end{verbatim}
or 
\begin{verbatim}
<CTA_MODELCLASS id="modelclass" name="example" flag_barrier="true"
T_step = "5400 SEC">
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
