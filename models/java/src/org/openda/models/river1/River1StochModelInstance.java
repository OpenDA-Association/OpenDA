/**
 * Simplified linear response of a river with two sections. This model does not perform
 * any real hydrodynamics computation, but only mimics the behaviour with a linear regression
 * formula. To add some time behaviour the model is started from the equilibrium for alpha_a=0
 * and alpha_b=0 and it performs an exponential relaxation towards the final equilibrium:
 * x0_equilibrium = xa0+ 0.1 * alpha_a
 * x1_equilibrium = xb0+ 0.15 * alpha_b + 0.03 * alpha_a
 * 
 * section a is the downstream section of the two and x[0] models the waterlevel at the upstream end
 * of section a. alpha_a is the change in friction in section a. Dito for the upstream section b.
