OpenDA installation on a Windows platform
=========================================


With the following instructions, the OpenDA software can be installed on
a Windows machine:

-  Download the `OpenDA
   binaries <https://github.com/OpenDA-Association/OpenDA/releases>`__.
   Note that the OpenDA binaries include a 64-bit Java 11 installation
   to be used by the program.
-  Extract the OpenDA distribution file to the desired location on your
   computer. Note: OpenDA does not work when it is installed on a
   location with a space in the path (like “``My Documents``”).
-  Open the OpenDA GUI by clicking the file ``oda_run_gui.bat`` in the
   folder ``<path_to_openda_release>/bin``.
-  Try to run an example. You can find examples in the
   ``<path_to_openda_release>/examples`` directory. An example that can
   easily be executed is found in
   ``model_example_blackbox/blackbox_example_calibration/Dud.oda``.
   After opening this file in the GUI, you can run the simulation. For
   the examples ``model_dflowfm_blackbox`` and ``model_delft3d`` in this
   folder, it is necessary to connect to existing models.
