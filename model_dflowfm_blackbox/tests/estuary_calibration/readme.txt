The m-files can be used to plot results after running the corresponding
simulations. The results are not very good yet, settings of the noise model
and the number of ensembles are to be tuned after the restart functionality of
DFlow FM is improved.

In this example noise is added to a waterlevel boundary specified as astronomical components.



Model description

The model is a very simple representation of a prototype estuary with a western boudary (left)
that connets to the open sea and a river flowing into the model at the eastern end. The main 
characteristics of the initial model BEFORE calibration are:
- domain x=0 to 99km with 500m grid-cells
- sloping bathymetry from -8m to -5 m
- 2 tidal constituents at western boundary
 M2 0.6m 0.0degr
 S2 0.1m 0.0degr
- constant river influx of 500m^3/s at eastern boundary
- uniform bed friction of 0.02 Manning
- 10 minute timestep
- observation points at 30, 60 and 90 km from the western boundary

Observations for calibration

The observations for the calibration are generated by another version of the model with other
parameter settings. The differences are:
- 10% added to the sloping bathymetry varying from -8m to -5 m
- 2 tidal constituents at western boundary
 M2 0.6m 0.0degr
 S2 0.2m 0.0degr (i.e 10cm more S2 amplitude)
- uniform bed friction of 0.02 Manning corrected by
 10% 0% and 20% relative to the first-guess.
