/**
 * DataObject for one WDM (Watershed Data Management) file.
 *
 * See http://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?wdm(1) :
 * A WDM file is a binary, direct-access file used to store
 * hydrologic, hydraulic, meteorologic, water-quality, and
 * physiographic data.  The WDM file is organized into data
 * sets (DSN = Data Set Number).  Each data set contains a specific type of data, such
 * as streamflow at a specific site or air temperature at a
 * weather station.  Each data set contains attributes that
 * describe the data, such as station identification number,
 * time step of data, latitude, and longitude.  A WDM file may
 * contain a single data set or as many as 200,000 data sets.
 * A data set may be described by a few attributes or by
 * hundreds of attributes.  Data can be added, deleted, and
 * modified without restructuring the data in the file.  Space
 * from deleted data sets is reused.
 *
 * To manually open and edit a wdm file use WDMUtil, which
 * is installed as part of the BASINS package, which is available from:
 * http://water.epa.gov/scitech/datait/models/basins/index.cfm
 *
 * The HSPF model can be installed as part of the BASINS package,
 * which is available from:
