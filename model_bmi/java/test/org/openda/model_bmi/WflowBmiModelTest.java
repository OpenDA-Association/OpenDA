/**
 * Test for running a BMI model (WFLOW).
 *
 * For information about the WFLOW model see www.openstreams.org
 * and https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/OpenS/wflow+-+PCRaster-Python+based+distributed+hydrological+models
 * For information about the PCRaster framework see http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/
 *
 * For this test to work, CPython version 2.7, PCRaster version 4.0 and the Thrift Python package need to be installed.
 * For this test to work, the openda python code and python resources must be present in the folder public/bin/python.
 * For this test to work, the following folders need to be present in the corresponding environment variables:
 * PATH: folder containing python executable (e.g. C:\Anaconda),
 *       folder with PCRaster dll files (e.g. C:\pcraster-4.0.1_x86-64\bin),
 *       folder with gdal dll files (e.g. C:\programs\gdal_release-1800-x64-gdal-1-11-1-mapserver-6-4-1\bin)
 * PYTHONPATH: folder with PCRaster python scripts (e.g. C:\pcraster-4.0.1_x86-64\python)
 * PYTHONHOME: folder containing python executable (e.g. C:\Anaconda\)
 *
 * This test only works when the OpenDA bin directory is the current working directory.
