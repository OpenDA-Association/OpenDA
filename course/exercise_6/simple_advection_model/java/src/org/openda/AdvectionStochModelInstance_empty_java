/** 
* The one dimensional advection model :
* 
* Some concentration of eg a pollutant is measured along a one dimensional transport. This can
* arise in a river or when considering a streamline of the flow in more dimensions. Advection or
* transport models often use upwind schemes for numerical simulation. Many different schemes have
* been proposed, but here we use a first-order upwind scheme. This scheme is known to show quite 
* large numerical diffusion.
