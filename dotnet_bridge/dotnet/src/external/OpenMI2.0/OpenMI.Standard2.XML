            Data exchange between components in OpenMI is nearly always related to one or
            more elements in a space, either geo-referenced or not. An element set in
            OpenMI can be a list of 2D or 3D spatial elements or, as a special case, a
            list of ID based (non spatial) elements. The latter is supported to allow the
            exchange of arbitrary data that is not related to space in any way. Possible
            element types are defined in <see cref="P:OpenMI.Standard2.TimeSpace.IElementSet.ElementType"/>.
            <para>
            An IElementSet is composed of an ordered list of elements having a common
            type. The geometry of each element is described by an ordered list of
            vertices. For 3D elements (i.e. polyhedrons) the shape can be queried by
            face. When the element set is geo-referenced co-ordinates (X,Y,Z,M) can be
            obtained for each vertex of an element.
            </para>
            <para>
            A geo-referenced element set needs to have a valid SpatialReferenceSystemWkt
            property set in the <see cref="T:OpenMI.Standard2.TimeSpace.ISpatialDefinition"/>. This is a string that
            specifies the OGC Well-Known Text representation of the spatial reference. An
            empty string indicates that there in no spatial reference, which is only
            valid if the ElementType is ID_BASED.

            While an IElementSet can be used to query the geometric description of a

            Although most models encapsulate static element sets, some advanced models

            version changes, the element set might need to be queried again during the
            computation process.

            Qualitative data described items in terms of some quality or categorization

            Optional interface to be implemented by components in addition to the
            <see cref="T:OpenMI.Standard2.IBaseLinkableComponent"/> interface. It provides additional methods for handling
            component state so it can be saved, restored and cleared. It
            can be left completely to the component to handle persistence of state
            or it can also implement <see cref="T:OpenMI.Standard2.IByteStateConverter"/> and provide ways
            for state to be converted to and from an array of bytes. A third-party
            could then handle the saving and loading of state data.
